Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
The Factory Pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

In the index file, we are currently using two classes directly. Using these constructors directly is fine for a small app.
However, as the app scales and we need more types of users (like Manager, Developer, Distributor, etc.),
directly using constructors everywhere becomes error-prone and hard to maintain.

If you forget to update every place where a new type is needed, you may get errors (missing imports, undefined classes, etc.).
The Factory Pattern solves this by centralizing object creation logic, making it easier to add new types and reducing the risk of such errors.
